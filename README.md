## Domain Learnable Data Augmentation Strategy on Few Labeled Data for the Application of Medical Image Segmentation 

This paper solves the problem of medical image segmentation with few labeled data.
This paper has two contributions:  
style-based data augmentation and new segmentation model.

We propose domain learnable data augmentation strategy (DLDAS) with Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to augment data feature space.\
Its code and readme is in ```DLDAS``` floder.

We modify the U-Net architecture to suit for few labeled data, proposing segmentation metric loss function with changeable learning curve to suit for medical image.\
Its code and readme is in ```Joint disc and cup segmentation model``` floder.
